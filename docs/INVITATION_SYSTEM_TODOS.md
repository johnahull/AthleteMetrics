## Performance Issues

### 1. ✅ RESOLVED: Inefficient Invitation Retrieval
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2818, 2919, 3238, 3375
**Issue:** Multiple endpoints call `storage.getInvitations()` which retrieves ALL invitations from the database, then filters in memory.
**Impact:** Poor performance with many invitations. O(n) memory usage.
**Solution:** Added `storage.getInvitationById(id)` method to BaseService that queries by ID directly.
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** All endpoints now use efficient `getInvitationById()` for O(1) lookups.

## Security Issues

### 2. ✅ RESOLVED: Hardcoded Admin Username Lookup
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` line 2614
**Issue:** Code assumes an "admin" user exists when req.session.user is not available
**Impact:** Will fail if admin user doesn't exist or has different username
**Solution:** Removed hardcoded admin username lookup, now requires proper authentication
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Authentication is now properly required. Returns 401 if not authenticated.

### 3. ✅ RESOLVED: Potential Username Enumeration via Timing Attack
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` line 3232-3234
**Issue:** Username check could leak information about existing usernames through response timing
**Impact:** Low - attacker could enumerate valid usernames
**Solution:** Added constant-time delay (100ms) regardless of whether username exists
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** All username availability checks now have uniform 100ms response time.

### 4. Missing CSRF Token on Accept Endpoint
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` line 384-390
**Issue:** `/invitations/:token/accept` is in CSRF skip list
**Impact:** This is acceptable since the endpoint uses single-use tokens
**Status:** This is actually correct design - documented for clarity

## Data Validation Issues

### 5. ✅ RESOLVED: No Validation of Team IDs
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2650, 2747
**Issue:** `teamIds` array is accepted without validating that teams exist
**Impact:** Could create invitations with invalid team references
**Solution:** Added validation to check that all teamIds exist and belong to the organization
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Both athlete and regular invitation endpoints now validate team IDs and organization ownership.

### 6. ✅ RESOLVED: No Validation of Organization Existence
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` line 2730-2733
**Issue:** Only regular invitations validate org exists, athlete invitations don't
**Impact:** Could create invitations for non-existent organizations
**Solution:** Added consistent validation for all invitation types
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** All invitation creation endpoints now validate organization existence.

## Race Condition Risks

### 7. ✅ RESOLVED: Concurrent Invitation Acceptance
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` line 3247-3252, `server/storage.ts` acceptInvitation method
**Issue:** Two users could potentially accept the same invitation simultaneously
**Impact:** Low probability but could create duplicate accounts
**Solution:** Wrapped invitation acceptance in database transaction with SELECT FOR UPDATE row-level locking
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** All invitation acceptance operations now use transactions with row locking to prevent race conditions.

## Email Handling

### 8. Email Send Failures Don't Rollback Creation
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2678-2695
**Issue:** If email fails to send, invitation is still created but emailSent is false
**Impact:** User experience issue - invitation exists but user never receives it
**Status:** This is actually acceptable - admins can resend. Documented for clarity.

### 9. No Email Delivery Retry Logic
**Location:** `server/services/email-service.ts`
**Issue:** Failed email sends are logged but not retried
**Impact:** Transient email service failures result in un-sent invitations
**Solution:** Implement retry queue or background job system

## Code Quality

### 10. ✅ RESOLVED: Duplicate Code for Email Sending
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2667-2697, 2756-2774, 2853-2877
**Issue:** Similar email sending logic is duplicated across endpoints
**Impact:** Maintainability - changes need to be made in multiple places
**Solution:** Extracted to shared `sendInvitationEmailWithTracking()` function
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** All three email sending blocks now use the shared helper function. Email sending is centralized for better maintainability.

## Test Coverage Gaps

### 11. ✅ RESOLVED: Missing Integration Tests
**Issue:** Current tests use mocks extensively but don't test actual HTTP endpoints
**Impact:** Could miss integration issues
**Solution:** Added supertest-based integration tests for critical paths
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Created `tests/integration/invitation-integration.test.ts` with comprehensive HTTP endpoint tests covering validation, performance, concurrency, and authentication.

### 12. ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Missing Edge Case Tests
**Tests needed:**
- ✅ Concurrent acceptance attempts (covered in integration tests)
- Invitation with expired organization
- Invitation with deleted team IDs
- Rate limiting edge cases (partially covered in integration tests)
- Session fixation prevention
**Status:** Integration tests cover concurrent acceptance and rate limiting. Additional edge cases for expired/deleted resources still needed.

## Future Enhancements

### 13. Add Invitation Templates
**Feature:** Allow organizations to customize invitation email templates
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** Medium

### 14. Add Invitation Expiry Notifications
**Feature:** Email users when their invitations are about to expire
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** Low

### 15. Add Bulk Invitation Import
**Feature:** Upload CSV to send invitations to multiple users
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** High
