# Database Migration Rollback Procedures

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step procedures for rolling back database migrations in case of issues during deployment.

## Safety Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Backups**: Database backups are created before every deployment
2. **Migration Validation**: Migrations are validated for safety before being applied
3. **Safe Migration Commands**: Using `db:migrate` instead of `db:push` to prevent accidental schema drops
4. **Backup Retention**:
   - Staging: 7 days
   - Production: 30 days

```

## Backup Locations

### Railway Automatic Backups
- **Location**: Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups
- **Retention**: 7 days (Hobby plan)
- **Access**: Via Railway web interface

### Manual Script Backups
- **Location**: `backups/` directory (local to CI runner)
- **Format**: `pre-deploy-backup-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.sql`
- **Retention**: Configured via `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable

## Rollback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Migration Fails During Application

**Symptoms:**
- Migration step fails in GitHub Actions workflow
- Database is unchanged (migration was not applied)

**Action Required:**
- ‚úÖ **NO ACTION NEEDED** - Deployment automatically stops
- Database remains in previous state
- Fix the migration issue and retry deployment

**Steps to Fix:**
1. Review migration error in GitHub Actions logs
2. Fix the migration file locally
3. Run `npm run db:generate` to regenerate migration
4. Commit and push the fix
5. Deployment will retry automatically

---

### Scenario 2: Migration Succeeds but Deployment Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Migration step succeeds
- Deployment or health check fails
- New database schema is applied but old code is running

**Danger Level:** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Schema and code are out of sync

**Action Required:**
1. **DO NOT** rollback the database schema
2. Fix the deployment issue or rollback application code
3. Ensure application code is compatible with new schema

**Why Not Rollback Schema?**
- Rolling back schema can cause data loss
- Breaking changes should be handled with backward-compatible migrations
- If absolutely necessary, use the backup restore procedure

---

### Scenario 3: Deployment Succeeds but Application Breaks

**Symptoms:**
- Deployment completes successfully
- Health checks pass initially
- Application errors appear after some time
- Database migration was applied

**Danger Level:** üî¥ HIGH - Production is affected

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Rollback Application** (if possible via Railway dashboard)
2. **Assess Data Impact**
3. **Decision Point:**
   - If data was written with new schema ‚Üí Keep schema, fix code
   - If no data was written with new schema ‚Üí Consider schema rollback

---

## Database Rollback Procedures

### Option 1: Rollback via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

**When to Use:**
- Within 24 hours of deployment
- No critical data written since migration
- Previous deployment was stable

**Steps:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Navigate to your service (Staging or Production)
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Find the previous deployment (before migration)
5. Click three dots (...) ‚Üí "Rollback"
6. Confirm rollback
7. Monitor health checks

**Limitations:**
- Railway CLI v3 does not support programmatic rollback
- Must be done manually via web dashboard
- Cannot rollback to specific migration version (all-or-nothing)

---

### Option 2: Restore from Backup (Manual)

**When to Use:**
- Rollback via Railway dashboard is not available
- Need to restore to specific point in time
- Data corruption occurred

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to Railway CLI
- Backup file from `scripts/backup-database.js`
- Database credentials

**Steps:**

#### 1. Download Latest Backup
```bash
# List available backups in Railway
railway backups list --service <SERVICE_ID>

# Or use local backup from CI artifacts (if available)
# Check GitHub Actions artifacts for backup files
```

#### 2. Stop Application Traffic (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Scale down to prevent writes during restore
railway down --service <SERVICE_ID>
```

#### 3. Restore Database
```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway run --service <SERVICE_ID> psql $DATABASE_URL < backup-file.sql

# Or using pg_restore if backup is in custom format
railway run --service <SERVICE_ID> pg_restore -d $DATABASE_URL backup-file.dump
```

#### 4. Verify Restoration
```bash
# Connect to database
railway run --service <SERVICE_ID> psql $DATABASE_URL

# Check table counts
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  n_tup_ins - n_tup_del as row_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY tablename;

# Verify critical tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM teams;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM measurements;
```

#### 5. Restart Application
```bash
railway up --service <SERVICE_ID>
```

#### 6. Run Health Checks
```bash
node scripts/health-check.js
```

### Option 3: Create Reverse Migration (Safest for Production)

**When to Use:**
- Need to remove a recently added feature
- Want to preserve data integrity
- Have time to create proper reverse migration

**Steps:**

#### 1. Create Reverse Migration
```bash
# Example: If you added a column, create migration to remove it
# Edit shared/schema.ts to remove the change

# Generate new migration
npm run db:generate

# This creates a new migration that reverses the previous change
```

#### 2. Review Generated Migration
```bash
# Check the migration file in drizzle/migrations/
cat drizzle/migrations/XXXX_reverse_feature.sql

# Ensure it only reverses the intended change
# Should NOT contain DROP TABLE without IF EXISTS
```

#### 3. Test Locally
```bash
# Apply migration to local database
npm run db:migrate

# Test application functionality
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test:integration
```

#### 4. Deploy Reverse Migration
```bash
# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: reverse migration for feature X"
git push origin develop

# Deployment workflow will:
# 1. Backup database
# 2. Validate migration
# 3. Apply reverse migration
# 4. Deploy code
```

## Prevention Best Practices

### 1. Write Backward-Compatible Migrations

**DO:**
```sql
-- Add nullable column (safe)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN middle_name TEXT;

-- Add column with default (safe)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Create new table (safe)
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (...);
```

**DON'T:**
```sql
-- Drop column (data loss!)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email;

-- Add non-nullable column without default (breaks existing code)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN required_field TEXT NOT NULL;

-- Rename column (breaks existing code)
ALTER TABLE users RENAME COLUMN email TO email_address;
```

### 2. Use Feature Flags

For breaking changes, use feature flags to:
1. Deploy new code with feature disabled
2. Apply database migration
3. Gradually enable feature
4. Monitor for issues

### 3. Test Migrations Locally

```bash
# Test migration
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

# Test rollback (if using Drizzle rollback feature)
# Note: Drizzle Kit doesn't support automatic rollbacks
# You must create reverse migrations manually
```

### 4. Monitor After Deployment

- Watch application logs for errors
- Monitor database performance metrics
- Check error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Verify critical user flows

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Validate migrations locally
npm run db:validate

# Generate new migration
npm run db:generate

# Apply migrations locally
npm run db:migrate

# Push schema (development only - NEVER in production)
npm run db:push

# Backup database (via Railway)
node scripts/backup-database.js

# Health check
node scripts/health-check.js

# Connect to staging database
railway run --service <STAGING_SERVICE_ID> psql $DATABASE_URL

# Connect to production database
railway run --service <PRODUCTION_SERVICE_ID> psql $DATABASE_URL
```
