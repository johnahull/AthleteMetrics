# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Default Admin Credentials Removed
- **Issue**: Weak default admin credentials ("admin123")
- **Fix**: Removed default fallback values for `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- **Impact**: Application now requires strong environment variables to be set
- **Requirements**:
  - `ADMIN_USER` must be at least 3 characters
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` must be at least 12 characters
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL` is optional (for admin notifications)

### 2. Session Security Hardened
- **Issue**: Weak session configuration with default secret
- **Fix**: Implemented secure session configuration
- **Changes**:
  - Required `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable (minimum 32 characters)
  - Set `resave: false` to prevent unnecessary saves
  - Set `saveUninitialized: false` to prevent session creation for unauthenticated users
  - Added `httpOnly: true` to prevent XSS attacks
  - Added `sameSite: 'strict'` for CSRF protection
  - Set `secure: true` in production for HTTPS-only cookies

### 3. Password Requirements Strengthened
- **Issue**: Weak password requirements (6 characters minimum)
- **Fix**: Applied strong password requirements to all users
- **New Requirements**:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

## High Priority Security Improvements

### 4. Rate Limiting Implemented
- **Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
- **Fix**: Added rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- **Configuration**:
  - 15-minute window
  - Maximum 5 attempts per IP
  - Applied to `/api/auth/login` and `/api/invitations/:token/accept`

### 5. Sensitive Data Logging Minimized
- **Issue**: User IDs, emails, and organization details logged in plain text
- **Fix**: Reduced sensitive information in log messages
- **Changes**:
  - Removed user emails and IDs from login logs
  - Removed detailed user/organization IDs from access validation logs
  - Kept only essential debugging information without PII

## Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables are now **REQUIRED** for security:

```bash
# Admin credentials (required)
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourStrongPassword123!
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@domain.com  # Optional

# Session security (required)
SESSION_SECRET=your-32-character-or-longer-session-secret

# Database connection (existing)
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
```

## Additional Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. Set all required environment variables before starting the application
2. Generate a strong random SESSION_SECRET (32+ characters)
3. Use a strong ADMIN_PASSWORD following the new requirements

### Future Security Enhancements:
1. Add security headers middleware (helmet.js)
2. Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
3. Add input sanitization for text fields
4. Consider implementing account lockout after failed attempts
5. Add audit logging for administrative actions

## Testing Security Fixes

1. **Environment Variable Validation**: Application will exit with error if required variables are not set
2. **Password Strength**: New user registration and password changes will enforce strong passwords
3. **Rate Limiting**: Excessive login attempts will be blocked temporarily
4. **Session Security**: Cookies will be secure and HTTP-only in production

## Breaking Changes

- **Environment Variables**: `ADMIN_USER`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `SESSION_SECRET` are now required
- **Username-based Authentication**: Admin users login with username (not email)
- **Password Requirements**: Existing users may need to update passwords to meet new requirements
- **Session Cookies**: More restrictive cookie settings may affect some client configurations
