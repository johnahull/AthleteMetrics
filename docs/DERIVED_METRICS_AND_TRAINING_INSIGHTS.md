## Executive Summary

This document outlines the derived metrics and training insights that transform raw performance measurements into actionable intelligence for coaches and athletes. These metrics reveal true performance improvement, talent identification, training effectiveness, and injury risk patterns.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Measurements
- **7 core metrics**: FLY10_TIME, VERTICAL_JUMP, AGILITY_505, AGILITY_5105, T_TEST, DASH_40YD, RSI, TOP_SPEED
