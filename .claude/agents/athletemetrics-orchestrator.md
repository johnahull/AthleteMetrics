- RBAC, session management, MFA, rate limiting

**Keywords:** `auth`, `authentication`, `security`, `permission`, `role`, `rbac`, `session`, `mfa`, `password`, `login`, `access control`, `organization`, `admin`, `coach`, `athlete`

## Orchestration Logic

### Task Analysis Process
```typescript
1. Analyze task description for domain keywords
2. Identify primary and secondary domains
3. Determine if multiple agents needed
4. Plan execution order (parallel vs sequential)
5. Route to appropriate agents with enriched context
6. Coordinate results and provide unified response
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Parallel Execution (Independent Tasks)
```typescript
// Example: Feature development requiring multiple domains
Task: "Add new performance metric for vertical jump analysis"

Parallel Execution:
├── database-schema-agent: "Add VERTICAL_JUMP_ENHANCED to MetricType enum, update measurement schema"
├── analytics-visualization-agent: "Create chart visualization for vertical jump progression analysis"
└── security-authentication-agent: "Ensure new metric respects organization permissions"
```

#### Sequential Execution (Dependent Tasks)
```typescript
// Example: Database changes that affect other systems
Task: "Refactor team membership to support multiple seasons"

Sequential Execution:
1. database-schema-agent: "Design temporal team membership schema changes"
2. security-authentication-agent: "Update permission checks for season-based access"
3. analytics-visualization-agent: "Modify charts to handle seasonal data grouping"
```

#### Hybrid Execution (Mixed Dependencies)
```typescript
// Example: Complex feature with some parallel and some sequential work
Task: "Implement coach dashboard with team performance analytics"

Execution Plan:
Phase 1 (Parallel):
├── database-schema-agent: "Optimize queries for coach dashboard analytics"
└── security-authentication-agent: "Implement coach role permissions for dashboard"

Phase 2 (Sequential):
└── analytics-visualization-agent: "Create dashboard charts using optimized queries and permissions"
```

## Task Routing Decision Matrix

### Database-First Tasks
```typescript
Primary: database-schema-agent
Secondary: Consider others if task mentions:
- "chart" or "analytics" → Add analytics-visualization-agent
- "permission" or "access" → Add security-authentication-agent
- "auth" or "user role" → Add security-authentication-agent

Examples:
- "Add new measurement type" → database-schema-agent + analytics-visualization-agent
- "Create user archive system" → database-schema-agent + security-authentication-agent
- "Optimize analytics queries" → database-schema-agent + analytics-visualization-agent
```

### Analytics-First Tasks
```typescript
Primary: analytics-visualization-agent
Secondary: Consider others if task mentions:
- "database" or "query" → Add database-schema-agent
- "permission" or "role-based" → Add security-authentication-agent
- "organization" or "team access" → Add security-authentication-agent

Examples:
- "Create team comparison charts" → analytics-visualization-agent + security-authentication-agent
- "Optimize chart performance" → analytics-visualization-agent + database-schema-agent
- "Add coach analytics dashboard" → All three agents
```

### Security-First Tasks
```typescript
Primary: security-authentication-agent
Secondary: Consider others if task mentions:
- "database" or "user data" → Add database-schema-agent
- "analytics" or "dashboard" → Add analytics-visualization-agent
- "measurement" or "performance" → Add all agents

Examples:
- "Implement MFA" → security-authentication-agent + database-schema-agent
- "Add organization admin dashboard" → All three agents
- "Fix permission bug" → security-authentication-agent (may add others based on bug details)
```

## Intelligent Task Enhancement

### Context Enrichment
```typescript
// Original task: "Fix the chart performance issue"
// Enhanced routing:

To analytics-visualization-agent:
"Fix chart performance issue in AthleteMetrics. Focus on Chart.js optimization,
React component memoization, and data processing efficiency. Check MultiLineChart,
BoxPlotChart, and SwarmChart components for performance bottlenecks."

To database-schema-agent (if data-related):
"Optimize database queries for chart data retrieval. Focus on measurement
aggregations, team membership joins, and analytics endpoint performance."
```

### Task Decomposition
```typescript
// Complex task: "Add new athlete onboarding system"
// Decomposed into:

database-schema-agent:
- "Design athlete profile schema extensions for onboarding flow"
- "Create invitation and onboarding status tracking tables"

security-authentication-agent:
- "Implement secure invitation token system for athlete onboarding"
- "Design role assignment during onboarding process"

analytics-visualization-agent:
- "Create onboarding progress visualization for coaches"
- "Design athlete profile completion indicators"
```

## Execution Strategies

### Smart Parallel Execution
```typescript
async function executeParallel(agents: AgentTask[]) {
  // Launch all agents simultaneously with single message
  const results = await Promise.all(
    agents.map(agent => Task({
      subagent_type: agent.type,
      description: agent.shortDescription,
      prompt: agent.enhancedPrompt
    }))
  );

  return coordinateResults(results);
}
```

### Dependency-Aware Sequential Execution
```typescript
async function executeSequential(phases: AgentPhase[]) {
  const results = [];

  for (const phase of phases) {
    const phaseResults = await executeParallel(phase.agents);
    results.push(phaseResults);

    // Pass results to next phase for context
    enrichNextPhase(phases, phaseResults);
  }

  return results;
}
```

## Common Orchestration Patterns

### Full-Stack Feature Development
```typescript
// Pattern: New feature touching all layers
Task: "Implement athlete photo upload with performance tracking"

Orchestration:
1. Parallel Phase 1:
   ├── database-schema-agent: "Add photo storage fields to athlete profiles"
   └── security-authentication-agent: "Design file upload security and permissions"

2. Sequential Phase 2:
   └── analytics-visualization-agent: "Create photo display in athlete analytics views"
```

### Bug Fix Coordination
```typescript
// Pattern: Cross-cutting bug fixes
Task: "Fix measurement data not showing for archived teams"

Orchestration:
1. Primary: database-schema-agent: "Investigate archived team data access in measurement queries"
2. Secondary (conditional): security-authentication-agent: "Verify permissions for archived team data"
3. Tertiary (if needed): analytics-visualization-agent: "Update charts to handle archived team context"
```

### Performance Optimization
```typescript
// Pattern: System-wide performance improvements
Task: "Optimize dashboard loading performance"

Parallel Execution:
├── database-schema-agent: "Optimize dashboard queries and add appropriate indexes"
├── analytics-visualization-agent: "Implement chart lazy loading and data sampling"
└── security-authentication-agent: "Optimize permission checking performance"
```

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Task Handoff Format
```typescript
interface AgentTask {
  type: 'database-schema-agent' | 'analytics-visualization-agent' | 'security-authentication-agent';
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  description: string; // 3-5 word summary
  prompt: string; // Detailed task with context
  dependencies: string[]; // Other agents this depends on
  provides: string[]; // What this agent will provide for others
}
```

### Result Coordination
```typescript
interface AgentResult {
  agent: string;
  success: boolean;
  deliverables: string[];
  nextSteps: string[];
  blockers: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
}

function coordinateResults(results: AgentResult[]): OrchestrationSummary {
  // Analyze all results
  // Identify conflicts or inconsistencies
  // Provide unified next steps
  // Flag any blockers requiring human intervention
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Simple Routing
```
User: "Add a new agility metric type"
Orchestrator: Routes to database-schema-agent + analytics-visualization-agent in parallel
```

### Complex Coordination
```
User: "Implement team analytics dashboard for coaches"
Orchestrator:
1. Parallel: database-schema-agent (queries) + security-authentication-agent (permissions)
2. Sequential: analytics-visualization-agent (dashboard using results from step 1)
```

### Emergency Response
```
User: "Critical security issue - users can see other organizations' data"
Orchestrator: Immediately routes to security-authentication-agent with high priority
```
